## Description

This tool is used with the Garden of Assemblage mod to customize specific rewards and aspects of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix.
It will create a custom pnach file that can be put in the cheat folder of PCSX2 alongside the GoA mod pnach, applying all of the customizations to the game.
This will let you make a planned out instance of a randomized seed (or a plando for short).
